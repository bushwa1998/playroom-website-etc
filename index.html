i want to build a website looks like this,  i built this on cargo. but i want to build one website by myself.

Edit
I'll help you create a website that captures the artistic, experimental layout style of your Cargo site. This design has a really interesting scattered, collage-like aesthetic with overlapping text elements and mixed typography.


Artistic Portfolio Website
Interactive artifact 
I've created a website that captures the experimental, scattered aesthetic of your Cargo design! Here are the key features I've implemented:

Design Elements:

Scattered Layout: Text elements positioned at various angles and locations, mimicking your collage-like composition
Mixed Typography: Different font weights, sizes, and styles to create visual hierarchy
Rotated Elements: Most text blocks are slightly rotated for that organic, hand-placed feel
Interactive Hover Effects: Elements respond when you hover over them
Year Tags: Red year labels scattered throughout, just like in your original
Key Sections Recreated:

Profile section with bio text on the left
"Printing in Progress" book project
"Design Pathways" with manifesto connection
"Things we've done here make it 'here'" with sketch box
"nation of scatterbrain"
"WEAR * zine" with asterisk
"asterisk as a lifeform" with dog icon
Technical Features:

Fully responsive design that adapts to smaller screens
Subtle floating animations for organic movement
Click interactions for engagement
Clean, semantic HTML structure
Custom CSS that you can easily modify
The website maintains the artistic, experimental feel of your Cargo site while being built from scratch. You can easily customize colors, fonts, positioning, and add new content sections. Would you like me to adjust any specific elements or add additional features?




what you made is so ugly!!! teach me how to create a diy website without paying yearly fee!!

Free Hosting Options:
GitHub Pages (Most recommended for artists/portfolios)

Completely free with custom domain support
Perfect for static websites like portfolios
Create a repository, upload your HTML/CSS files, enable Pages
Your site will be at username.github.io/repositoryname
Netlify

Free tier with 100GB bandwidth/month
Drag and drop deployment
Custom domains supported
Great for beginners
Vercel

Free for personal projects
Super fast deployment
Good for more advanced sites
Neocities

How to Build Your Site:
Learn basic HTML/CSS (takes 1-2 weeks):
HTML for structure (headings, paragraphs, images)
CSS for styling (colors, fonts, positioning)
Start with simple layouts, then get creative
Tools you need (all free):
Text editor: VS Code (free)
Browser for testing
Basic image editor: GIMP (free)
For your artistic style, focus on:
CSS position: absolute for scattered layouts
transform: rotate() for tilted text
Custom fonts from Google Fonts
Flexbox or CSS Grid for responsive layouts
Want me to show you a simple starting template that you can actually build upon, or would you prefer a step-by-step tutorial for getting set up with GitHub Pages?




ok i'll go with github! (which i already have account) and i also have VS code. i need step-by-step instruction of set up with GitHub Pages

Edit
Perfect! Here's your step-by-step guide to set up GitHub Pages:

Step 1: Create a New Repository
Go to GitHub.com and sign in
Click the green "New" button (or the "+" in top right → "New repository")
Name your repository (e.g., my-portfolio or tzu-yun-website)
Make sure it's set to Public
Check the box "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository"
Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
In your new repository, click the "Settings" tab (far right in the menu)
Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
Choose "main" branch
Leave "/ (root)" selected
Click "Save"
GitHub will show you your website URL: https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
Step 3: Clone Repository to Your Computer
In your repository, click the green "Code" button
Copy the HTTPS URL
Open VS Code
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
Type "Git: Clone" and select it
Paste the URL and choose where to save it on your computer
Click "Open" when VS Code asks
Step 4: Create Your First Webpage
In VS Code, create a new file called index.html
Add this basic starter code:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, I'm [Your Name]</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
</body>
</html>
Create another file called style.css:
css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
    margin: 40px;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 2em;
}
Step 5: Upload Your Changes
In VS Code, go to the Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
You'll see your files listed
Click the "+" next to each file to stage them
Type a commit message like "Add initial website files"
Click the "✓" button to commit
Click "Sync Changes" or the sync button
Step 6: Check Your Live Website!
Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub to process
Go to your URL: https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
Your website should be live!
Next Steps:
Every time you make changes in VS Code, just commit and sync
Your website updates automatically
Add images by creating an images folder and uploading files
Experiment with CSS to recreate that scattered, artistic layout you want
Need help with any of these steps? Or ready to start building that experimental layout?





i dont have git: clone on my VS code

Edit
No worries! You can still get your repository into VS Code. Here are a few ways:

Option 1: Install Git Extension (Easiest)
In VS Code, click the Extensions icon (square icon on left sidebar)
Search for "Git"
Install the official "Git" extension by Microsoft
Restart VS Code
Now try the Git: Clone steps again
Option 2: Download Repository Directly
Go to your GitHub repository page
Click the green "Code" button
Click "Download ZIP"
Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
In VS Code: File → Open Folder → Select your extracted folder
Option 3: Create Files Manually
In VS Code: File → Open Folder → Create a new folder (name it same as your repository)
Create your index.html and style.css files
When ready to upload:
Go to your GitHub repository
Click "uploading an existing file"
Drag your files from your computer to GitHub
Commit the changes
Option 4: Use GitHub Desktop (User-friendly)
Download GitHub Desktop (free)
Sign in with your GitHub account
Clone your repository through the app
It will create a folder on your computer
Open that folder in VS Code
Which option sounds easiest for you? Option 2 (Download ZIP) is probably the quickest to get started, and you can always set up proper Git later once your site is working!




when i want to sync, it told me to check my Git "use name" and "user.email"

Edit
Ah! You need to tell Git who you are. Here's how to fix this:

Method 1: Using VS Code Terminal (Recommended)
In VS Code, open the Terminal: View → Terminal (or Ctrl+`)
Type these two commands (replace with your info):
bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Use the same email that's connected to your GitHub account!

Example:

bash
git config --global user.name "Tzu-Yun Wei"
git config --global user.email "tzuyunwork@gmail.com"
Press Enter after each command
Now try syncing again!
Method 2: If Terminal Doesn't Work
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
Type "Git: Configure" and see if options appear
Or go to File → Preferences → Settings
Search for "git.user" and set your name and email there
Method 3: Check What's Already Set
First check if you already have settings:

bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
If nothing shows up, then set them with the commands above.

Once you've set your name and email, VS Code should let you sync! Try the sync button again and let me know if you get any other errors.





can i just directly code on GitHub instead dealing with local file and vscode?

Edit
YES! Absolutely! GitHub has a built-in code editor that's perfect for simple websites. Here's how:

Method 1: GitHub's Web Editor
Go to your repository on GitHub.com
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it index.html
Start typing your HTML code directly in the browser
When done, scroll down and click "Commit new file"
Repeat for style.css
Method 2: Press "." (Period) Key - GitHub's Secret!
Go to your repository page
Press the "." (period) key on your keyboard
GitHub opens a VS Code-like editor right in your browser!
Create/edit files directly
Use the Source Control panel on the left to commit changes
Method 3: Edit Existing Files
Click on any file in your repository
Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
Make your changes
Scroll down and commit
The Benefits:
No local setup needed
Changes go live immediately (within 2-5 minutes)
Everything saves to GitHub automatically
Can work from any computer
Quick Start:
Go to your repository
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Type index.html
Paste this starter code:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My website is live!</p>
</body>
</html>
Commit the file
Wait 2-5 minutes and check your GitHub Pages URL!
Want to try this approach? It's definitely simpler for getting started!





how to see this website in live? during my coding?

Edit
Great question! Here are ways to see your website live while coding:

For GitHub Direct Coding:
Your GitHub Pages URL:

Go to Settings → Pages in your repository
Your live URL is shown there: https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
Bookmark this URL!
When you make changes:

Edit your file on GitHub
Commit the changes
Wait 2-5 minutes (GitHub needs time to rebuild)
Refresh your live URL to see changes
Speed tip: Open two browser tabs:

Tab 1: Your repository for editing
Tab 2: Your live website for viewing
If You Want Instant Preview:
Option 1: Use GitHub Codespaces (Free tier available)

In your repository, click the green "Code" button
Click "Codespaces" tab
"Create codespace on main"
You get VS Code in browser + live preview!
Option 2: Use CodePen for quick experiments

Copy your HTML/CSS to codepen.io
See changes instantly
Copy back to GitHub when happy
Option 3: Simple local preview

Download your files
Double-click the index.html file
It opens in your browser locally
Refresh after changes
Pro Tip:
Since GitHub Pages takes 2-5 minutes to update, I suggest:

Make several small changes at once
Commit them all together
Then wait and check the live site
The 2-5 minute delay is just how GitHub Pages works - it's the trade-off for free hosting! Want to try setting up your first page and see it live?




ok i see it, how should we continue building this website?
How about i write down the setting and design of my original cargo site and then we write them into css or html?

For example:
The Width of the site: 65
The padding: 1.3

Font:

Body: Favorite Book

Edit
Perfect approach! Yes, let's recreate your Cargo site settings systematically. This is exactly how professional developers work - analyzing the existing design and translating it into code.

Let me help you gather all the settings first, then we'll convert them to CSS.

Information I Need:
Layout Settings:

Width: 65 (65% of screen?)
Padding: 1.3 (1.3em? pixels?)
Background color?
Overall page margins?
Typography:

Body: Favorite Book
What about headings? (H1, H2, etc.)
Different font sizes for different elements?
Line height/spacing between lines?
Letter spacing?
Colors:

Text colors (body text, headings, links)
Background colors
Accent colors (like those red year tags)
Element Positioning:

How are elements scattered? (specific positions or random?)
Rotation angles for tilted text?
Spacing between elements?
Interactive Elements:

Hover effects?
Link styling?
Any animations?
Can you check your Cargo site's settings and give me these details? Also, can you tell me:

Is the width 65% of the browser window?
Is padding 1.3em or 1.3rem?
What's the exact name of the "Favorite Book" font - is it a Google Font or custom?
Once I have these specs, we can build it section by section!




截圖 20250722 中午12.20.29.png
i found a similar layout website, this is the html and the look, can we do our website like this one? After building this, we can think about the interactive elements?

Edit
Perfect! This is a much cleaner, more focused approach. I can see this is a beautiful, minimal typography-focused design - very different from the scattered layout we tried before. This looks much more professional and readable.

Looking at this design, I can see:

Clean, minimal layout
Monospace/typewriter font
Left-aligned text
Simple black text on white background
Numbers in brackets [01], [02], etc.
Clean typography hierarchy
Links in different colors (green, blue)
Very readable, portfolio/CV style
This would work perfectly for your portfolio! Let's build this step by step:

First, let me create the basic structure:

Artistic Portfolio Website
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 2 
Great! I've created the basic structure matching that clean, minimal style. Now we can:

Next Steps:
Fill in your actual project details - Replace the placeholder project names with your real work
Add proper links - Link to your actual projects, Substack, Instagram
Fine-tune the typography - Adjust font size, spacing, colors to match exactly what you want
Add interactive elements like:
Hover effects on links
Maybe some subtle animations
Click interactions
Questions for you:
Do you like this cleaner approach better than the scattered layout?
What are your actual project names/works that should go in the numbered list?
What links do you want (your Substack URL, Instagram, project pages)?
Any specific colors you want for the links instead of green/blue?
This foundation gives us the clean, professional look of that reference site. Once you're happy with the content and basic styling, we can add those interactive elements you mentioned!

Should we continue refining this, or would you prefer to go back to the more experimental scattered layout?




this layout looks great, but i dont like the font, can we change it to inclusive sans? and shall i copy the html and css of this version to my github?

Edit
Yes, absolutely! Let's change to Inclusive Sans and then you can copy it to GitHub.


Artistic Portfolio Website
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 3 
Perfect! Now it's using Inclusive Sans font.

To copy this to your GitHub:
Method 1: Copy & Paste (Easiest)

Click the copy button in the artifact above to copy all the HTML
Go to your GitHub repository
Create a new file called index.html (or edit your existing one)
Paste the entire code
Commit the changes
Wait 2-5 minutes and check your live site!
Method 2: Save as Files You could also:

Copy the HTML into a file called index.html
Save it on your computer
Upload it to GitHub
Since everything is in one HTML file (CSS included in the <style> section), you only need to upload this single file.

After uploading:
Your site should look much cleaner with the Inclusive Sans font
We can then work on:
Adding your real project information
Adding proper links
Interactive elements like hover effects
Any other design tweaks you want
Want to try uploading it now and see how it looks live? Then we can continue customizing!




the following are selected project titles:

Projects
[ 2024-ongoing ] Printing in Progress: What Makes a Book a Book?
[ 2024 ] nation of scatterbrain
[ 2024 ] Things we've done here make it "here"
[ 2022-2024 ] asterisk as a lifeform

Education
[ 2025 ] Design Pathways → self-research → manifesto

Visual Design Service
[ 2024 ] 2024 TPABF: Groovy Quote, Key Visual Design

I want to add pictures after each project name, how can i do that?

Edit
Great project titles! Let's update the HTML with your actual projects and add image placeholders. Here's how to add images:


Artistic Portfolio Website
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 4 

Artistic Portfolio Website
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 5 
Perfect! I've updated it with your project titles and added image placeholders. Now here's how to add your actual images:

To Add Your Images:
Step 1: Prepare Your Images

Save your project images as JPG or PNG files
Name them clearly: book-project.jpg, scatterbrain.jpg, etc.
Recommended size: around 800px wide (they'll resize automatically)
Step 2: Upload Images to GitHub

In your GitHub repository, create a new folder called images
Click "Create new file"
Type images/ and then add a filename (like book-project.jpg)
Upload your image file
Repeat for each image
Step 3: Update the HTML The code is ready! It's looking for images at:

images/book-project.jpg
images/scatterbrain.jpg
images/things-done.jpg
images/asterisk-lifeform.jpg
images/design-pathways.jpg
images/tpabf-design.jpg
Alternative: If You Don't Have Images Yet
You can temporarily comment out the image lines by adding <!-- before and --> after each <img> tag, like:

html
<!-- <img src="images/book-project.jpg" alt="Book project image" class="project-image"><br><br> -->
Want to upload this version now and then add images later? Or do you have images ready to upload?





i've upload the image and change the code, but the image is not showing up. 

the code line looks like this:
        <span class="number">[2024]</span> Things we've done here make it "here"<br>
        <img src="images/things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png" alt="Things we've done project" class="project-image"><br><br>

Edit


The issue is likely the file path or filename. Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

Check These Common Issues:
1. File Location Check

In your GitHub repository, do you see a folder called images?
Inside that folder, is there a file called things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png?
The structure should look like:
your-repository/
├── index.html
└── images/
    └── things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png
2. Try the Direct GitHub URL Method Instead of src="images/...", try using the full GitHub URL:

html
<img src="https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/images/things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png" alt="Things we've done project" class="project-image">
Replace yourusername and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

3. Check Browser Developer Tools

Right-click on where the image should be
Select "Inspect Element"
Look for any red error messages about the image not loading
4. Test with One Image First Try this simple test - replace one image line with:

html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/cccccc/666666?text=Test+Image" alt="Test image" class="project-image">
If this test image shows up, then the problem is with your image file path.

Can you tell me:

What's your GitHub username and repository name?
Do you see the images folder in your repository?
Does the test placeholder image work?




my username is bushwa1998, my repository name is playroom-website-etc
I've change my code to

<img src="https://bushwa1998.github.io/playroom-website-etc/images/things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png" alt="Things we've done project" class="project-image">

its not showing up still

Edit
Let's debug this! The URL looks correct. Let's check a few things:

Step 1: Test the Direct Image URL
Copy this URL and paste it directly in your browser address bar:
https://bushwa1998.github.io/playroom-website-etc/images/things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png
Does the image load by itself? If not, that means there's an issue with the file upload or path.
Step 2: Check Your Repository Structure
Go to: https://github.com/bushwa1998/playroom-website-etc
Do you see an images folder?
Click on the images folder - is your PNG file there?
What's the exact filename shown in GitHub? (case-sensitive!)
Step 3: Try the Test Image
Replace one of your image tags with this test:

html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/cccccc/666666?text=Test+Image" alt="Test image" class="project-image">
If this shows up, then your HTML is fine and it's just a file path issue.

Step 4: Alternative Upload Method
If the image folder isn't working, try:

Go to your repository
Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Drag your image directly to the main repository (not in a folder)
Then use: <img src="things_weve_done_here_make_it_here_01.png" ...>
Can you try Step 1 first and let me know what happens when you paste that URL directly in your browser?
